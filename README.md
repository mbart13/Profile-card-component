# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

To see the project go [here](https://profile-card-component.mbart13.vercel.app/).

This is one of the challenges from https://www.frontendmentor.io, where goal is to get the page looking as close to the design as possible.
Although this is a newbie challenge, it has some tricky background images.

In this project I used:
- SASS and BEM methodology
- pseudo-elements for styling
